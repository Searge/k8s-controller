    "This section shows the fundamental concept of a pointer. A pointer is a special variable that doesn't hold a value like a number or text, but instead holds the memory address of another variable. The `&` operator is used to get the memory address of a variable (`&x`). The `*` operator, when used before a pointer variable (`*ptr`), is called \"dereferencing.\" It allows you to access the actual value stored at that memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `ptr` stores the location of `x` in memory. So, printing `ptr` shows a memory address, while printing `*ptr` follows that address to find and show the value of `x`, which is `1`. A pointer is essentially a reference or a \"link\" to another variable."

    "#### Memory Management with Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to create variables directly in memory without first declaring a named variable like `x`. The built-in function **`new()`** allocates memory for a specific type (in this case, `int`), initializes it to its \"zero-value\" (`0` for integers), and returns a pointer to that memory location. You can then use the dereference operator (`*`) to change the value at that address, as seen with `*ptr = 10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, setting a pointer to **`nil`** means it no longer points to any memory address. The memory that was allocated by `new()` is now no longer referenced by `ptr`. Go's automatic garbage collector will eventually find this unused memory and free it up, which helps prevent memory leaks."

    "A `sync.WaitGroup` is essentially a counter that allows your main program to wait for a number of goroutines to finish their work. Think of it as a checklist for a manager. You use `Add()` to tell the `WaitGroup` how many tasks you are starting. Then you use `Wait()` to pause the main program until the counter goes back to zero. Each goroutine calls `Done()` when it completes its task, which decrements the counter by one. This is the standard way to prevent a program from exiting before all its concurrent tasks are done.\n",

This is crucial because if there was an error or a panic inside the goroutine, `wg.Done()` would still be called. Without `defer`, if the goroutine crashed, the counter would never be decremented, and your program would get stuck at `wg.Wait()` forever, causing a deadlock."
